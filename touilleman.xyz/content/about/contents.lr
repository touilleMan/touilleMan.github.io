I'm Emmanuel Leblond, engineer at [Scille](http://scille.eu) working most of the time in Paris, France.

I have a C & embedded systems background but fall in love with Python since then.

# A bit of my work

Most of my work involve Python and open-source, among patches and PRs I've ported projects to Python 3: [authomatic](http://peterhudec.github.io/authomatic) and [diesel](https://github.com/dieseldev/diesel).

I also enjoy mongoDB, so I created [mongopatcher](https://github.com/touilleMan/mongopatcher), a tool for database schema upgrade, and [umongo](https://github.com/Scille/umongo), an ODM working with both async and sync mongoDB drivers.
Beside, I'm part of the [mongoengine](https://github.com/MongoEngine/mongoengine) team.

Finally, I help maintaining a C ini parser library, the well-named [iniparser](https://github.com/ndevilla/iniparser).
